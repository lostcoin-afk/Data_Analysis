Data Analysis on Advanced House Prices Dataset

I performed data analysis on the Advanced Housing Prices Dataset, beginning with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset structure. Next, I applied Feature Engineering to handle data issues such as missing values and to extract hidden patterns that could improve model performance.
Following this, I conducted Feature Selection to retain only the most relevant features that significantly contribute to the target variable. I then proceeded to train and test a Linear Regression model, using a test split that produced the following evaluation metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.13
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.03
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.17
- RÂ² Score: 0.8517
Finally, I applied the trained model weights to test.csv to generate predictions.
